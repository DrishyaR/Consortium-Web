# Certo  GHCI project
The application aims at improvising the voting system in India. Currently the voting procedure involves human involvement. The counting of votes and the verification of the voter is done manually. Due to human intervention the system may lack security. So our idea is to implement the e-voting project that will aim to digitalize all the procedures that are involved during voting. The main steps are mentioned below: Identification of an individual Verification of an individual Casting vote Counting of votes Special system for physically impaired people thereby providing them the right to vote.
The physically impaired can be provided with the access to voice recognition so that there is no involvement of human, when the voter cast the vote.
